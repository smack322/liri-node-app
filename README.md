What the project does?

The Liri Chat Bot is a small node based app that makes axios calls out to OMDB, Bands In Town and uses the Spotify API to query movies, concert details and song / artist data.

The program is run by the terminal through the following...
node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'  

Why the project is useful?

The chat bot provides a quick means for learning basics about your favorite movies, songs or where your favorite bands will be playing next. Entering in these simple commands, making a call out to the various APIs and getting the data back in seconds is a pretty quick way to learn and is pretty simple / user friendly.
